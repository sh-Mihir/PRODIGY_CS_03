This is my task number - 3 of my Cyber Security internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Welcome to the Password Complexity Checker Tool! The Password Complexity Checker is a Python tool designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on specific complexity criteria. It analyzes the input password and classifies it into one of three categories: strong, moderate, or weak. The tool also provides suggestions for improving the password's strength.

Features:
* Character Type Analysis: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters in the password.
* Sequential and Repetitive Character Detection: Identifies if the password contains sequential (e.g., abc, 123) or repetitive characters (e.g., aa, 11).
* Password Length Validation: Ensures the password length is within the specified range (5 to 64 characters).
  
Classification:
* Strong: Passwords with a mix of character types, no sequential or repetitive characters, and a length between 8 and 64 characters.
* Moderate: Passwords with a mix of character types, either sequential or repetitive characters, and a length between 5 and 8 characters.
* Weak: Passwords that do not meet the above criteria.
  
User Feedback: Provides detailed feedback on the password composition and suggestions for improvement.
